        <li>1 LB strawberries</li>
        <li>8oz cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>12oz mascarpone cheese, chilled</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>14 grams unflavored gelatin, (2 packets)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Topping/Decor</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>6 strawberries, halved</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Oil the bottom and sides of a 9" springform and line the sides with 1-2 strips of parchment paper</li>
        <li>Place graham crackers In the bowl of a food processor, pulse into fine crumbs. Transfer crumbs to bowl, add 1 Tbsp sugar and 8 Tbsp melted butter. Stir to evenly moisten crumbs then press into the bottom of a 9" springform pan going 1/2" up the sides. Freeze 15 minutes or refrigerate 30 minutes for crumbs to set. </li>
        <li>Wash & pat dry strawberries then hull and quarter. Puree in blender or food processor until smooth then strain through a sieve and set aside. Should have 1 1/2 cups puree.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 8 oz cream cheese and 2/3 cup granulated sugar. Beat on medium/high speed 2 minutes until fluffy and smooth, scraping down the bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cups heavy whipping cream and beat until fluffy (3-5 minutes on high speed). Reduce speed to medium/low and beat in 12 oz mascarpone until well combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 cups strawberry puree and 2 Tbsp lemon juice and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a shallow heat-safe bowl, add 1/2 cup cold water and sprinkle the gelatin over the top. Set aside 5 minutes to bloom and absorb the water. Microwave gelatin for 30-35 seconds, stirring every 10 seconds. Heat and stir until fully dissolved and liquid looks clear. Scrape any gelatin pieces against the bowl to help them dissolve. With mixer on med-low speed, gradually add gelatin and beat until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Transfer cheesecake filling over the chilled crust, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight until completely chilled. </li>
    </ol>
